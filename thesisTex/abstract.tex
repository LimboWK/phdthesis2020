Belle II experiment is a next-generation super B-factory experiment. The targeted instantaneous luminosity is 
$8 \times 10^{35}~ \text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$ and the expected integrated luminosity is 50 ab$^{-1}$ by 2030 with the majority of data collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance using SuperKEKB accelerator.

The thesis is based on the time-dependent $\it{CP}$ violation study of $B^0 \to K_S^0 K_S^0 K_S^0$ decay to precisely measure the $\it{CP}$ parameters $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ in penguin-dominated $b \to s$ transition, which is sensitive to New Physics effects. Such a precise measurement mainly depends on determination of the distance between two vertices of two neutral $B$ mesons. The blind analysis and fit by a unbinned maximum likelihood method are performed using about 62.8 fb$^{-1}$ recorded experiment data from Belle II detector 2019 and 2020 (spring and summer) operation. The measurement results: $\mathcal{S}= - \text{sin}(2\phi_1) = -0.82 \pm 0.85 \: (\text{stat}) \pm 0.07 \: (\text{syst})$ and $\mathcal{A}= -0.21 \pm 0.28 \: (\text{stat}) \pm 0.06 \: (\text{syst})$ are obtained.

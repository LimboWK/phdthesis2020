Belle II experiment is a next-generation B-factory experiment that is aimed to search for New Physics. Most of data will be collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance using SuperKEKB facility. It's designed at luminosity of $8 \times 10^{35}~ \text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$ which is 40 times higher than its predecessor KEKB.

The thesis is based on the time dependent $\it{CP}$ violation study of $B^0 \to K_S^0 K_S^0 K_S^0$ decay. The purpose is to precisely measure the $\it{CP}$ parameters $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ in penguin-dominated $b \to s$ transition. It's sensitive to New Physics effects and quite interesting compared to other modes with tree-level contamination. Any undisputed deviation on $\it{CP}$ parameters could be a signal beyond the Standard Model. Such precise measurements mainly require clean signal extraction, $B^0$ vertex reconstruction, flavor tagging and proper decay time resolution modeling. This thesis covers the development and optimization of analysis tools on the four aspects above. The blind fit and toy MC study are also included before using data, which show a reasonably good consistence in $\it{CP}$ parameter measurements. By using data from Belle II 2019 and 2020 (Spring and Summer) operation at about 62.8 fb$^{-1}$ integral luminosity, the measurement results of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$: $\mathcal{S}= - \text{sin}(2\phi_1) = -0.82 \pm 0.85 \: (\text{stat}) \pm 0.07 \: (\text{syst})$ and $\mathcal{A}= -0.21 \pm 0.28 \: (\text{stat}) \pm 0.06 \: (\text{syst})$ are obtained. The result is dominated by statistical uncertainty and currently consistent with the Standard Model and the previous results in Babar and Belle.

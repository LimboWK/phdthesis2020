\section{Time Dependent \textit{CP} violation measurement}
The measurement of \textit{CP} violation in transitions of 
$B^0$ mesons to their common \textit{CP}
eigenstate $K_S^0 K_S^0 K_S^0$ requires the analysis of the time-dependent differential decay rates. The distribution of events based on the decay time difference $\Delta t$ and flavor is dependent on mixing induced and/or direct \textit{CP} parameters $\mathcal{S}$ and  $\mathcal{A}$. 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\Delta t, q ) = 
\frac{e^{-|\Delta t|/\tau_{B^0}}}{4\tau_{B^0}}
\begin{Bmatrix}
1 + q \cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathcal{S}sin(\Delta M_d \Delta t) + 
\mathcal{A}cos(\Delta M_d \Delta t)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Here, same as discussed in Chapter 1, $\Delta M_d$ is the mass difference of two $B^0$ mass eigenstates, $\Delta t$ is the decay time difference of signal-side and tag-side $B^0$, namely $\Delta t = t_{CP} - t_{tag}$.  $\tau_B^0$ is the lifetime of $B^0$. And $q = + 1 (-1)$ is the indicator of flavor when tag-side meson is $B^0$ ($\bar{B^0}$). To a good aproximation using Eq(1.47), $\mathcal{A}$ is expected to be zero and $\mathcal{S} = -\text{sin}(2\phi_1)$, given the final states of $K_S^0 K_S^0 K_S^0$ corresponding to \textit{CP}-even ($n_f = + 1$). The previous result from Belle and Babar are shown in Fig 4-1.

\section{Data Sample and Event Selection}
The simulation data (MC) is taken from Belle II official MC campaign 13, named MC13. Both signal MC and generic MC are produced. In signal MC, one of the $B^0$ from $\Upsilon(4S)$ decays into final states 3$K_S^0$ then into 6 charged pions, while the other $B^0$ decays generically using all possible channels. In generic MC,  $B^0$ from  $\Upsilon(4S)$ all decay generically using all possible channels.

The signal MC sample is produced by EvtGen package with provided ``decay.dec" file that describes the required decay mode and branching fraction. As $K_S^0 \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ leads to large background with poor vertex quality, only the final states to 6 charged pions is used. The corresponding branching fraction used is $\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0) = 6.0 \times 10^{-6}$. The simulation takes the $\Upsilon(4S)$ as the mother particle and uses decay mode ``VSSBMIX" to generate its decay process to two scalar $B^0$ mesons with mixing. Then the $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ is simulated based on only the possible phase-space of kinematics that final states could have, which no $\it{CP}$ violation parameters is used, so the generated sample in both generic and signal MC13 has zero input for sin2$\phi_1$ and $\mathcal{A}$.
In this analysis of $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ , 1 million signal MC events with and without overlay of beam background are generated separately independent from physics runs, and 1ab$^{-1}$ generic MC is also generated. 

\subsection{$K_S^0$ Selection}
Benefiting from the KsFinder, $K_S^0$ reconstruction is first based on the cut-based selection, then candidates is purified largely by cutting on the KsFinder output. Here two major additional selections are used in addition to the cut-based method in section 3.1. Firstly, in order to reduce the impact from slow pions from $D^{*}$ decays, $K_S^0$ momentum is set to larger than 0.05 GeV/c, see Fig 4-1. Secondly, regarding the different tracking quality of daughter $\pi^{+/-}$, the distribution of fitted invariant mass named ``InvM" of $K_S^0$ are varied. So based on the SVD hits number pions from $K_S^0$ have, different cuts of fitted invariant mass ``InvM" are used on the $K_S^0$ to further improve the reconstruction purity, see the discussion in detail as Fig 4-5 shows.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{ks-p}
	\caption{The distribution of $K_S^0$ momentum. Candidates smaller than 0.05GeV/c are rejected.}
	\label{fig:ks-p}
\end{figure}

The reconstruction quality of $K_S^0$ highly depends on the flight distance. $K_S^0$ that decay in the inner region of VXD yields more hits on the SVD layers from its charged daughters, which is critical in performing a proper tracking. An essential difference between Belle and Belle II is the level of beam background which Belle II is around 10 $\sim$ 20 times higher regarding the luminosity. So the CDC of Belle II becomes much more sensitive to this effect when doing track finding. Track finding is performed on VXD and CDC separately. The track candidates from different sub-detectors then merged into a same track by extrapolating the trajectory and pattern matching. However, for certain fraction of $K_S^0$, they decay outside of layer 5 of SVD, and if these tracks are not passing the windmill structure of SVD, there will be no SVD information recorded. This is due to the feature of SVD track finding, where a track candidate needs either at least 3 SVD hits to form a SVD-only track, or 2 hits to form a hit double-lets, to be used for combining tracks with other track candidates. Single hit case is filtered out to suppress the large fraction of beam background induced by fake hits on a single layer. This effect is shown in Fig 4-2. Similar to Fig 3-1, $K_S^0$ are categorized based on how many SVD hits their daughters have. SVD10 and SVD01 stands for $K_S^0$ that only $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ has non-zero SVD hits number. SVD11 and SVD00 stands for $K_S^0$ that both or neither charged pions have SVD hit non-zero SVD hits number. This is related to the track quality of $K_S^0$ such that SVD11 $K_S^0$ has the best quality and SVD00 has the worst. It's clear that SVD00 $K_S^0$ show up at about 10 cm where SVD layer 5 is placed at $r=10.5$ cm. And most of SVD10(SVD01) $K_S^0$ also show at same range because one of the pions is passing the overlapping area. The structure of SVD is shown in Fig 4-3 and the fraction for each types of $K_S^0$ in $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ is listed in Table 4.1.

\end{figure}

The vertex fit of $K_S^0$ is performed using TreeFit package. \cite{refId0} Using fitted $K_S^0$ momentum and energy as four-vector, fitted invariant mass (called InvM) is different from the one obtained directly using daughters' four-momentum (calle M). This quantity often receive impact of the measurement uncertainties. If we check out the distribution of fitted invariant mass based on daughters' SVD hits. The dispersion if much severe in $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ than it is in generic sample due to the larger fraction of long flight length $K_S^0$, see Fig 4-4.

	\label{fig:m-before-fit}
\end{figure}
Using the fitted invariant mass (the bottom left in Fig 4-4), a slight tuned mass window can be set on each $K_S^0$ type and improve the purity. We apply the cut on InvM based on $K_S^0$ types to reduce background in mass sideband.
 Details of the InvM window are in Table 4.2.
 
 In summary, we first select $K_S^0$ using ``stdKshort:merged" from BASF2 library, which the internal cut on M is 0.45 to 0.55 GeV/c and all converged vertex fit candidates are kept using TreeFit. Then we reject $K_S^0$ candidates with momentum smaller than 0.05 GeV/c. After this, InvM cut on each $K_S^0$ types are applied and finally the candidates are selected by KsFinder cut at 0.74.

\subsection{$B^0$ Signal Reconstruction}



\begin{comment}
The energy of $B^0$ should be exactly the half of the energy in CMS frame, so replacing the energy of $B^0$ with half of the beam energy in the calculation of invariant mass of reconstructed $B^0$, $M_{bc}$ can be expressed as: 

\begin{equation}
M_{bc} = \sqrt{(s/2+\boldsymbol{p_B p_0})^2/{E_0^2}-\boldsymbol{p_B^2}} 
\end{equation}
where $E_0$ and $\boldsymbol{p_0}$ are the energy and momentum of CMS in the lab frame. $s$ is the invariant mass of the system. By the definition of $M_{bc}$ is clear that it's independent from the mass hypotheses of reconstructed particle. On the contrary, $\Delta{E}$ can be presented as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta{E} = (2q_B q_0-s)/2\sqrt{s}
\end{equation}
where $q_B$ and $q_0$ are the 4-vector of $B^0$ and CMS in lab frame. \cite{Bevan_2014}. $\Delta{E}$ receives sizable contribution from beam energy dispersion but is generally dominated by the reconstruction resolution of detector. It's expected to be centered at zero  And it's affected by the invariant mass of particle. These two variables are much more independent than $p_B$ and $E_B$, so combination of them can be used as a 2-D distribution which yields correctly reconstructed $B^0$.

 The reconstruction are conducted on both samples with or without beam background, to evaluate the influence of beam background. As discussed in previous section, $K_S^0$ efficiency is depending on the CDC tracking especially for the long-lived ones. Yet CDC is suffering from the high beam background level at targeted luminosity of SuperKEKB. Even though at current stage, the MC samples are generated with early phase 3 geometry and luminosity, such effect might be trivial, the comparison of sensitivity among them is still worth noticing. The event selection of using different $K_S^0$ criteria are included as well.
 
\end{comment}
By combining three $K_S^0$ particles from selected dataset, we can reconstruct $B^0$. The beam-constraint mass $M_{bc}$ and energy difference $\Delta E$ are used to extract signal. 
 The $B^0$ candidates with $M_{bc} > 5.2$ GeV and $|\Delta{E}| < 0.2$ GeV are accepted. Then the vertex fit using TreeFit is performed on each $B^0$ candidate and we keep ones with chiProb $> 0.001$. When multiple $B^0$ candidates show up in a single event, a rank by their vertexing quality is performed using $\chi^2$ of the vertex fit, where the smallest have the highest rank. The best candidates are selected  by the highest rank. Since the BCS is based on the vertexing quality that might introduce bias in the vertex positions for $\it{CP}$ fit, we check the distribution of the vertex $\chi_2$ from TreeFit before the BCS is used, as shown in Fig 4-6 top right. The distribution of candidates number per event without BCS is shown in top left of Fig 4-6 as well, showing small difference between data and generic MC. The distribution of candidates per event is consistent with the one from signal MC (bottom left of Fig 4-6). The 2D distribution of $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ from $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ signal MC13 is shown in Fig 4-6 bottom right.
 
 The summary of $B^0$ selections for is:

The Table 4.4 shows that, given the newly developed $K_S^0$ selection, efficiency of $B^0$ reconstruction as well as purity is slight improved in Belle II compared to Belle.

	\caption{The efficiency is defined by the fraction of best candidates among the MC input number.

All values in the parenthesis are calculated in $| M_{bc} |- 5.28 < 0.1$ and $|\Delta E| < 0.1$, or called ``signal region" where efficiency is lower but purity is higher. }
\end{table}
\subsection{Continuum Suppression}
The production cross-section of $B\bar{B}$ from $\Upsilon{(4S)}$ receives a sizable contribution from other flavor of quarks other than b quark. This calls a demand to distinguish a specific $B\bar{B}$ decay events from combinatorial background from $e^+e^- \to q\bar{q}$, so called continuum suppression. The background shape projection on spectrum of $M_{bc}$ is a continuum shape. The rejection of this background is essential since they are the dominated background.  In the case of $b \to s$ charmless decay like $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$, the number of continuum background can exceed the signals by a few orders of magnitudes. They can be reduced by taking advantage of the difference on kinematics of their decay products.
It's also useful to perform a decay products angular distribution study to further reduce the continuum background. In a $B\bar{B}$ event, two mesons ae produced almost at rest in the CMS frame since the resonance state $\Upsilon(4S)$ is  just slightly lighter than beam energy. As a results, decay products fly out more isotopically, compared to other lighter flavor decay which  flying-out particles trajectories are more back-to-back distributed. Thanks to experience from ARGUS and CLEO collaboration\cite{Bevan_2014}, a set of practically useful variables has been implemented into BASF2 framework that can be used in continuum suppression. CLEO cones momentum can be presented as Eq (4.1), where $ p_i $ is momentum of particle i in Rest Of Event (particles in a event except for the ones used to reconstructed $\it{CP}$-side $B^0$), $\theta_i$is angle against thrust of reconstructed $\it{CP}$-side B meson.

\begin{equation}
L_n = \sum_{i\in ROE}^{} p_i \times |cos\theta_i|
\end{equation}

Not only the variables defined by  CLEO cones of momentum are used, in fact, the modified Super Fox-wolfram momentum named  KSFW momentum are calculated based on event-shape based variables from every event in Belle II case as well.
KSFW momentum are defined as: 
\begin{equation}
KSFW = \sum_{l=0}^{4}( R_l^{so} + R_l^{oo}) + \gamma \sum_{n=1}^{N_t}|P(t)_n|
\end{equation}
The first term is:
\begin{equation}
R_l^{so} = \frac{\alpha_{cl}H_{cl}^{so} +
				\alpha_{nl}H_{nl}^{so}+
			\alpha_{ml}H_{ml}^{so}}{E^*_{beam}-\Delta E}
\end{equation}

when l is odd: 
\begin{equation}
	H_{nl}^{so}=H_{ml}^{so}=0
\end{equation}
and in the meanwhile: 
\begin{equation}
	H_{cl}^{so} = \sum_i \sum_{jx}Q_i Q_{jx}|p_{jx}|P_l(cos\theta_{i,jx})
\end{equation}
i runs over B daughters particles and jx for other particles in ROE. Q is charge and p is momentum for each particle. $P_l(cos\theta_{i,jx}$ is the l-th order Legendre polynomial of cosine of i and jx-th particles.
On the other hand, for l is even, 
\begin{equation}
	H_{xl}^{so}=\sum_i \sum_{jx}|p_{jx}|P_l(cos\theta_{i,jx})
\end{equation}
The second term in Eq (4.2), when l is odd: 
\begin{equation}
	R^{oo}_l = \sum_j \sum_k \beta_l Q_j Q_k |p_j||p_k|P_l(cos\theta_j,k)
\end{equation}
j and k runs over ROE particles and others are same as Eq(4.8).
For even l: 
\begin{equation}
	R^{oo}_l = \sum_j \sum_k \beta_l |p_j||p_k|P_l(cos\theta_j,k)
\end{equation}
$\beta$ is five Fisher coefficient to determine in training. 
Using above definitions, we can form the possibility density functions for KSFW, cosine angle against B meson thrust and $\Delta Z$ of two side vertex.  Then based on each event's variables' value, we can calculate a ratio as Eq(4.9), where the Likelihood $L$ of signal and background are obtained from the possibility density functions, see Eq(4.10).
The $ \mathcal{R} $ is: 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{R} = \frac{L_S}{L_S+L_B}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
L_{S/B} = P(KSFW)_{S/B} \times P(cos\theta_B)_{S/B} \times P(\Delta Z)_{S/B}
\end{equation}
where P is probability density function for signal and continuum, regarding the discriminating variables in the parentheses. For example, the distribution of a variable called $R_2$ that is the most important one shown in Fig(4-7) which possibility density function is varied in signal and background.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{r2}
	\caption{$R_2$ serves as the highest weight as a variable in discriminating the continuum events, having a drastically different distribution between signal and background. $R_2$ is the ratio of the second to the zeroth KSFW momentum in Eq(4.2)}
\end{figure}



  In order to maximize the performance for this analysis, these categories of variables (KSFW, CLEO cone momentum and angular distributions) are combined as a training input for FastBDT classifier, and targeted variables is the continuum event flag. The working principles of this framework is much similar to KsFinder. The MC samples using signal $B\bar{B}$ events and off-resonance in each of the flavor ($q\bar{q}$) are prepared in a scaled ratio of their cross-section in $\Upsilon{(4S)}$ energy. The same events reconstruction procedures for $B^0$ is applied as well. Then the events passing the reconstruction for $B^0$ are used for training the continuum suppression. The fraction of signal and background is set to 1:1 during the training. Noted that the ratio does affect the choice of cut value when applying the suppression. The 1:1 ratio is chosen to make classifier learns about signal and background equally. Then we determine the cut based on the curve of FOM like KsFinder. The variables used in training are listed in Table 4.5 with their abbreviations and importance rank is in Table 4.6.

The correlation between these training variables are shown in Figure 4-8. The correlation among the variables are varied in signal and background. Also, no strong correlation for one variable over the others is found, which shows a good selection of using these variables. The output of continuum suppression classifier is called ``FBDT\_CS".

\subsection{Resonance Background}
Besides the major contribution from continuum background, charmonium resonance that mediates through $b \to c$ transition brings odd $\textit{CP}$ eigenvalue in the final states as same as $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$. Monitoring their contribution is also important. Basically, one needs to check the resonance states formed by two $K_S^0$ with corresponding invariant mass. In $B^0 \to X(K_S^0 K_S^0) K_S^0$,  there are two types of resonant events that give out same final states, one is resonant signal and the other is resonant background. For $b \to s$ transitions as resonance signal because of the $\it{CP}$-even final states, X could be $f_2(1270)$,$f_0(1500)$,$f_{2}^{'}(1525)$,$f_0(980)$,$f_0(1710)$ and $f_2(2010)$. And for $b \to c$ transition as resonance background because of $\it{CP}$-odd final states, X could be $D^0$, $J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$,  $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, and $\chi_{c2}$.

The number of these background in signal reconstruction could be further reduced by implementing veto on invariant mass of 2$K_S^0$. However, such veto should be carefully validated with data. The distribution of invariant mass of X should agree well in MC and data. Some of these resonance have not been implemented inside generic MC production for Belle II. Given the very limited statistics of data accumulation we used in this analysis, we only present the expected number of these resonances in 400$fb^{-1}$ luminosity from generic $\Upsilon{(4S)}$ events. These numbers should be re-checked in the future when data accumulation increases, and veto must be based on the structure of 2$K_S^0$ invariant mass from data as well. Details about the expected yields can be found in Table 4.6. Currently there is no veto used for rejecting the resonant background, which should be fine given the estimated background number is about 1 event.

\subsection{$B\bar{B}$ background and self-cross feed}
Another possible contribution of backgrounds are the background from $B\bar{B}$ events including the charged and the neutral ones. The estimated contributions of these types can be checked with charged $B\bar{B}$ samples and the mixed samples. For this channel, the number of events from  \textbf{$B\bar{B}$} is very limited. Self-cross feed backgrounds stands for the events from the signal-like events but the tag-side particles help form a fake signal. The combined contributions from $B\bar{B}$ background and self-cross feed is about 3\% in the channel and we don't perform special treatment on them at current luminosity.

\subsection{Signal Extraction}
After determining the contribution of all kinds of background, the event selections defined in Table 4.3 is applied to signal MC, generic MC and also the data. The integral luminosity from generic MC is 1ab$^{-1}$ and the data used in this analysis is the full data set from 2019 and 2020 spring and summer. 
The official processing of data used is proc11 and bucket 9,10,11,13,14,15 and the integral luminosity is about 62.8fb$^{-1}$. To be noticed, the good runs from data has slightly lower luminosity. 

The unbinned maximum likelihood fit using RooFit package is performed to extract the signal. 2D fit using both $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta{E}$ are done by taking the probability density function as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(M_{bc},\Delta{E}) = 
f_{signal}\times \mathcal{P}_{sig}^{M_{bc}}\times\mathcal{P}_{sig}^{\Delta{E}}
+ 
(1-f_{signal})\mathcal{P}_{bkg}^{M_{bc}}\times\mathcal{P}_{bkg}^{\Delta{E}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}_{sig}^{M_{bc}}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{sig}^{\Delta{E}}$ are Gaussian and three Gaussians function. $f_{signal}$ is fraction of signal events. $\mathcal{P}_{bkg}^{M_{bc}}$ is  primarily continuum events, and presented as Argus distribution like Eq(4.12) shows, with a preset mass threshold at $c = 5.29$ GeV. 
\begin{equation}
f(x;\chi,c)=\frac{\chi^3}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Psi(\chi)}\cdot
\frac{x}{c^2}\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{c^2}}\cdot
exp\begin{Bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2}\chi^2(1-\frac{x^2}{c^2})
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation}
 $x$ is defined in $0<x<c$. $\chi$ and $c$ are parameters of the distribution, $\Psi(\chi)=\Phi(\chi)-\chi\phi(\chi)-\frac{1}{2}$ where $\Phi(\chi)$ and $\phi(\chi)$  cumulative distribution and probability density functions of the standard normal distribution, respectively. 
 $\mathcal{P}_{bkg}^{\Delta{E}}$  is modeled by first order Chebyshev polynomials. The shape parameters of signal events are determined by fitting to signal MC, and  then fixed as constants in fitting of 2D on $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ for generic sample and data. Fitting results on signal MC are show in Fig 4-11.

The continuum background is fitted also first on off-resonance generic samples to determine the shapes then fix them as constants for 2D fit, shown as follows:

Then we set the events number for signal and background as the only parameter in float, to use Eq(4.11) 
as 2D fit functions on 1ab$^{-1}$ generic sample and data, which the fit is also done using unbinned maximum likelihood fit.
For $B^0$ in generic MC sample, the 2D fit result projected on $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ is:

For the invariant mass of $K_S^0$ from $B^0$, we compared the distribution of ``InvM" and ``M" for all $K_S^0$ that have been used for $B^0$ reconstruction in data and generic MC. The distributions are shown in Fig 4-14 bottom, which the generic MC is scaled to the luminosity of data and agreed well.
For data, the 2D fit result projected on $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ is in Fig 4-14 top.

\end{figure}
 The number of signal events is extracted by integral of fit function over the signal region which is defined as $5.27 < M_{bc} < 5.29 $ GeV and $-0.1 < \Delta E < 0.1$ GeV.
 The expected signal events with ~35\% efficiency in this analysis is calculated as:
 \begin{equation}
 \mathcal{B}(B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0)=
 \frac{N_{sig}}{\mathcal{B}(K_S^0\to \pi^+\pi^-)^3\times
 	\epsilon_{rec}\times N_{B\bar{B}}}
 \end{equation}
 In 1 ab$^{-1}$ generic MC13, $7.7\times 10^8 \times 6\times 10^{-6}(BR:B^0\to3K_S^0) \times 21\%(BR:K_S^0\to \pi^+\pi^-) \times 35\% \simeq 339$. The fit result from $M_{bc}$/$\Delta E$ yields $341\pm 20$ events which agrees with expectation. The event number in sideband $M_{bc}<5.26$ GeV in generic MC is 507. Compared to Belle result with $772\times 10^6$ $B\overline{B}$ pairs used, signal from data yields $327\pm 19$, which is also consistent. In 62.8 fb$^{-1}$ data from Belle II, we extract $N_{sig} = 17.4 \pm 4.2$ in this region. Considering the good runs luminosity will be slightly lower than the recorded, the number of signal is in a good agreement with expectation. The sideband region $M_{bc}<5.26$ GeV contains 60 events in data. Both the results of expected event number for signals are consistent in generic MC and data.
To check linearity of the event number fitted from the $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ in this low statistics case, we extract the fraction of continuum backgrounds from generic MC13 sample rescaled to the experimental data luminosity, which yields about 46.5 background events in 62.8fb$^{-1}$. Then the series of (5,10,15,20,25,30) signal MC13 events is injected into the background, to perform the $M_{bc}$/$\Delta E$ fit to check the output signal events number. The fitted yield from $M_{bc}$/$\Delta E$ shows a good agreement on both signal and background events number in data equivalent luminosity. $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ distribution in each injection test are shown as well. Details about the linearity of signal events are in Fig 4-16.

The fraction of signal and background can be obtained by integral over signal box region using 2D P.D.F. We define signal box using signal MC distribution in Fig 4.13 and 4.14, which $5.269 < M_{bc} < 5.287$ GeV and $-0.09 < \Delta E < 0.12$ GeV. The results are:

N_{sigbox} = 12.6 \pm 3.9\\

Compared with Belle experience, which similar analysis is done by using about 1$ab^{-1}$ data, signal yield is $327.1 \pm 19.4$. The estimated branching fraction of $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ is:

\subsection{Kinematics and Vertexing Dependence on KsFinder} 

KsFinder largely reduce the combinatorial background of $B^0$. The previous section shows a good reconstruction performance at low statistics in early phase 3 data. Without the power of rejection provided by $K_S^0$ finder, rediscovery of $B^0 \to K_S^0  K_S^0  K_S^0$ in early phase 3 of Belle II won't be feasible.

\end{figure}
\end{comment}

 However, it's essential to check the potential impact on kinematics and vertexing of $K_S^0$ regarding the implementation of KsFinder. The $K_S^0$ classification uses information such as invariant mass and decay vertex which may propagate bias into $B^0$ vertexing, eventually may affect $\it{CP}$ parameters. Besides, kinematics bias might tune the shape of fit function and contribute bias in defining signal fraction used in \textit{CP} fit. At last, since we have different types of $K_S^0$ based on their SVD hit numbers, a check with $B^0$ based on different $K_S^0$ types are also worthy of doing.
 
 Given each type of $B^0$ based on how many CDC-only tracks it has in final states, the check on $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta{E}$ with or without KsFinder is done by fitting the distribution in signal. $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta{E}$ are modeled by double-Gaussian. Compared corresponding fit results, no clear bias on $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta{E}$ are found by using KsFinder or not. Results are plotted in Fig 4-17 and 4-18. The main distribution of $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta E$ show very trivial difference.

\end{figure}

Similar to the comparison of $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta{E}$, Z direction vertex position along with its uncertainties are also checked. No clear bias on vertex position and uncertainties are spotted either. Results are plotted in Fig 4.19 and 4.20. And it obivious that the resolution of vertex on z-axis is much worse when the final states of $B^0$ only have CDC tracks.

\end{figure}
Above all, no clear sign of bias on both kinematics and vertex position from using $K_S^0$ finder has been found, KsFinder implements a small shift on the vertex positions which is trivial compared to the large statistical uncertainty. For the moment, there's no correction on these variables are considered based on the neglect able difference from using KsFinder. And further effects will be watched in future improvement of KsFinder.

\subsection{Summary}
To properly reconstruct $B^0$, a typical cut-based loose selection of $K_S^0$ is first done and then developed KsFinder using FastBDT classification is applied. Due to the tracking issue regarding the $K_S^0$ daughters missing SVD hits, fit mass with varied cuts are used in addition. Combining $K_S^0$ candidates and implementing continuum suppression from event-shape analysis yield signal $B^0$ with relatively low background in full range. 2D fit on $M_{bc}$ and $\Delta{E}$ are performed to extract signal and background number inside defined signal box. The results are in a good agreement in data and MC, as well as Belle result. Potential data MC correction of using KsFinder has been studied. The potential bias on kinematics and vertexing are also studied, which are in a trivial level under the current luminosity.
